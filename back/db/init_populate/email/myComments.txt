Thanks again for signing up the World Cup 2014 Guess Club!

We are trying our best to make your World Cup 2014 experience more
fun.

Some friends asked the rankings are not changed after
each match. The fact is that there might be as many as 4 matches in
a day so we will run our judging jobs as a batch in the dawn. Also
an email like this one will be automatically sent to you with the
match reminder for today :)
Some friends also pointed out that we are missing certain features.
We are currently working on those and will deliver soon.

So stay tuned :)

Cheers,
Daming
